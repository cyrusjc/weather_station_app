Graph
    create a variable x that determines the time interval that the graph will show Ex. 30 seconds
    reach out to the database and query every n seconds for new inputs
        rows have a boolean value: read 
    potential start and stop "recording functionality" which only reads when a button is clicked on the UI 
    and stops when the button is clicked again
        "recording" of input values stored as text in seperate database with key as date
    replay option
        displays previous "recordings" in real time as they were inputed

Etch a sketch
    create a variable x to determine the frequency of database requests (essentially fps)
    reach out to database every x seconds and retrieve new instructions
    calculate the distance of the next point on the graph based on intensity of joycon coordinates
        ignore x=0 y=0
    clear button to reset sketch
    sketch begins in the middle by default, can build cursor-based starting points in the future
    sketches stored in database similarly to graph recordings
